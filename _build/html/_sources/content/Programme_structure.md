# Programme structure

At the University of Hertfordshire, a programme of study such as BEng, MEng or BSc requires students to study several specific modules at various academic levels.

The academic levels are defined as levels 4, 5 and 6 (equating to the first, second and final years of an Honours degree) and level 7 (Master’s degree level). This is in line with much of the rest of the UK Higher Education sector, the QAA Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and the QCDA Qualifications and Credit Framework.

The academic levels and years applicable to your programme of study are shown below:

|Year of study	|Academic level|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|	4|
|2|	5|
|3|	6 Industrial placement year (optional)|
|3/4|	6|


##	Modules

Most students will study 8 modules a year whilst on a full-time degree programme, four in the first semester and 4 in the second. However, note that some modules are spread over both semesters and therefore have a double weighting.

A 15-credit module encompasses 150 hours of student effort. Typically, two thirds of this is “directed learning” and a third is “non-directed learning” (i.e. time spent doing background reading and extra exercises that you may personally find in textbooks or module notes). In the early years directed learning will typically include 3-4 hours a week of timetabled classes, either lectures or tutorials with a member of staff. There may also be some laboratory experiments or practical work that has to be supervised by a member of staff. The rest of the time should be spent doing unsupervised experiments, set examples and tutorial questions (which may not be assessed) and assignments that will be assessed. As you progress to higher levels the number of timetabled classes is reduced with a greater emphasis on independent. Clearly the actual amount of independent time you spend on a module will vary considerably according to how hard you find the subject, how efficient you are, and your own personal standards!

The University regularly reviews the content, methods of delivery and assessment of modules. To aid this, students are asked to complete a feedback questionnaire towards the end of each module.  
Each module has a unique 'DMD Code' for example 6ENT1012. The first digit indicates the academic level of the module.  

On successful completion of a module a student is awarded 15 credit points (or 30 if given a double weighting). There is more detailed information in the Program Specification accessible from the Studynet/Canvas Programme pages.

##	Module Plans

A module plan consists of a timetable of the module’s classes, (such as lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions) and an assessment schedule. The master copy is published on Studynet/Canvas as part of the Module Handbook (under Module Information) and it may be subject to change during a module, so you should check it regularly.

Modules are assessed in various ways ranging from 100% Examination to 100% In-Course Assessment. In-Course Assessment may consist of a number of assignments, some of which may be based on practical experiments, and possibly some in-class tests. The Module Handbook for each module tells you the weighting between Examination and In-Course Assessment, the weighting of specific assignments and when they are to be submitted for marking.

##	The Sandwich Degree Option

The University of Hertfordshire has a strong heritage for producing Engineering and Technology graduates with industrially relevant skills.  The primary reason for this is that all students who do not have an industrial background are strongly advised to take the Sandwich Degree Option.  This involves spending at least 30 weeks in industry (typically in your third year with us) working on a project or as part of a design support team in an engineering company. Some reasons for doing a sandwich placement are.
-	Many students who make a success of their industrial placement are offered a job by the company they worked for.
-	Many companies will offer a major project for the final year when they have had the student work for them on industrial placement.
-	Most employers consider a Sandwich Degree to be a better qualification than a full-time degree.
-	There is statistical evidence to show that sandwich students gain a higher classification than full-time students given the same average marks in the second year.
Usually students are paid by the companies whilst on placement.  Students are responsible for securing their own placements, and the University offer comprehensive support for this via its Careers and Employment Service (https://www.herts.ac.uk/life/careers-and-recruitment).  

All placements must be approved by the Careers and Employment Service team and you are typically required to start work no later than 1st September.  Otherwise you will need to continue the full-time degree without a sandwich placement.

Whilst in industry you will be visited by a member of staff who will check your progress and will also check that the work that the company requires you to do is appropriate.

##	Transfer between Programmes

If you feel you have chosen the wrong degree programme then it may be possible to change provided:
- it is before the university deadline for such changes (usually the second teaching of October in semester A, and February in semester B),
- your entry qualifications for the new programme are satisfactory, and
- there is a vacancy on the new programme.

Initially you should discuss this with your programme leader and then with the programme leader for the programme you wish to change to. If they agree, you will need to complete and submit a transfer form.
Prior to requesting a transfer, it is vital that you seek advice any tuition fees matters, please contact student-finance@herts.ac.uk.  

##	Opportunities for Study Abroad

The University encourages students to take the opportunity of studying abroad. By spending part of your degree programme at a partner university in another country, you can benefit from the challenges and rewards of living, working and studying in another environment. Different perspectives, different approaches and different encounters can enrich you both personally and educationally and improve your future career prospects.

You can choose to take a semester or a full academic year at one of our partners depending on your programme requirements. The University has a number of well-established partnerships with universities and schools in mainland Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
There are two distinct ways of doing this. In the first way, you may undertake study abroad (either a year or a semester) as an alternative to an industrial placement. Your study will be over and above the modules you study back here at the University and will not influence your final degree classification or the accreditation of your degree by a professional engineering body in any way. However, your study abroad will be recognised (so long as you pass sufficient modules) by being awarded a pass in a zero-credit rated module and your degree award title will include the words ‘with a Year Abroad’ or ‘with a Semester Abroad’.

To be eligible for this option you must have passed 120 credits at level 4 and 120 credits at level 5 with an average of at least 60%.

The alternative is to replace either one Semester of, or all your second year with study abroad at a partner institution. In this case, modules are chosen to correspond as far as possible to the curriculum of the home programme. Whether you study for one semester or the whole year abroad, your degree classification will be based on Level 6 (and Level 7 in the case of the MEng) only. You need to be aware too that your degree will not be accredited by a professional Engineering body. However, your study abroad will be recognised (so long as you pass the modules) by being awarded a degree award title which will include the words ‘with a Year Abroad’ or ‘with a Semester Abroad’.

To be eligible for this option you must have passed 120 credits at level 4 and 120 credits at level 5.  
Information about Study Abroad and Exchanges (including list of the University’s partner universities, details of the application process and key deadlines) can be found in: https://www.herts.ac.uk/international/overseas-study/study-abroad.  

Please note that final approval to go ahead with Study Abroad must be given by the Study Abroad Coordinator (Carrie Ricketts: c.ricketts@herts.ac.uk). Visa applications or purchase of travel tickets must not be made until final approval is agreed.

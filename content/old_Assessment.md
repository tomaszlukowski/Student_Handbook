(assessment_details)=
##	Assessment Details

Modules can be assessed by exam and/or coursework, and this is defined in the Definitive Module Document (DMD).  For each of the modules you study you can find the DMD on Studynet/Canvas (under Units > Module Information > Definitive Module Document (DMD)).
The DMD will also show:
- The pass condition (e.g. pass overall)
- The weighting of each component (e.g. 50% exam, 50% coursework)

(examinations)=
###	Examinations

These are held at the end of many modules and usually have a substantial weighting. Pay careful attention to the University regulations that govern examinations as failure to abide by them could result in a zero mark for that examination.

Following the publication of results, students may request feedback on their exam script from the module leader. The nature of this feedback will be in the form of which questions you answered well and which questions were not answered so well.

(coursework)=
###	Coursework

Most of your modules will include a coursework component, also known as In-Course Assessment (ICA).
ICA usually consists of a weighted combination of in-class tests (which are subject to the same rules and regulations as examinations) and assignments. These are all assessed during the module so that students can get an idea of their progress. Assignments requiring the submission of a piece of coursework must be handed in as instructed on the assignment-briefing sheet by the due date given on the briefing sheet. Assignments are typically submitted via Studynet/Canvas.

You are responsible for familiarising yourself with requirements associated with the assessment for your modules as well as any submission deadlines or penalties (see UPR AS12 Appendix I ).

(late_assessment)=
##	Late coursework

Unless there are accepted Serious Adverse Circumstances or an extension has been given, lateness penalties apply (see UPR AS12 Appendix I ).
-	For each day or part thereof (or for hard copy submission only, working day or part thereof) for up to five days after the published deadline, coursework relating to modules at Levels 0, 4, 5, 6 submitted late (including deferred coursework, but with the exception of referred coursework), will have the numeric grade reduced by 10 grade points until or unless the numeric grade reaches or is 40. Where the numeric grade awarded for the assessment is less than 40, no lateness penalty will be applied;
-	Referred coursework submitted after the published deadline will be awarded a grade of zero (0).
-	Coursework (including deferred coursework) submitted later than five days (five working days in the case of hard copy submission) after the published deadline will be awarded a grade of zero (0).

(serious_adverse_circumstances)=
##	Serious Adverse Circumstances and Short-Term Extensions

Serious Adverse Circumstances (SAC) are significant circumstances beyond a student’s control that would have affected the student’s ability to perform to their full potential, please refer to: https://ask.herts.ac.uk/serious-adverse-circumstances-sac

The University operates a “fit to sit” policy, where “students who sit or submit an assessment deem themselves to be sufficiently able to take the assessment and cannot later claim to have suffered Serious Adverse Circumstances” (see UPR AS14 ).

In some cases, students are able to apply for Short-Term Extensions (STE) of up to 10 days, as defined in: https://ask.herts.ac.uk/coursework-extensions.  Please note that STEs are not available for exam alternative assessments including timed or constrained (e.g. 24 hour) assessments.  To apply for a STE, please contact the relevant module leader in the first instance.

(turnitin)=
##	Use of Turnitin Plagiarism Detection Software

In the School of Physics, Engineering and Computer Science all level 6 and 7 individual and group project reports will be run through Turnitin as a matter of routine. Other items of summative assessment may be put through Turnitin on a randomly-sampled basis or where plagiarism is suspected.

(feedback)=
##	Feedback

You will be receiving feedback on your work throughout your studies and it is important to recognise that there are many ways in which staff provide this and so it will take a variety of forms which may include the following:
- Handwritten (or typed) personalised comments on a report
- Generic comment sheet - A document summarising both good points and common mistakes and how to put them right.
- Live feedback in the classroom - either during a lecture or tutorial
- Worked solution using word/ powerpoint or computer programme
- Video - generic video explaining the common problems and how to overcome them.
- Podcast - similar to a video but takes up a lot less memory than a video.
- Feedback grid - A word or excel document with generic comments associated with the grading criteria. Staff tick or ring the relevant comments for each item within the assessment.
- Peer assessment - students asked to assess each other against a set of criteria. Commonly used in group work but can be for individual work.
- Live demo/presentation/viva - oral personal feedback
Equally, you may receive ‘feed forward’ where guidance is provided to help you prior to submitting an assignment. Examples of this include:
- Live guidance during a lecture or tutorial before submission
- Frequently asked questions with answers on StudyNet/Canvas
- Phased assessment - breaking a large assessment into stages so that students can get interim feedback before completing the next stage.
- Generic feedforward - making feedback from the equivalent previous year’s assessment available as part of this year’s briefing.

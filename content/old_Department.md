# (old) Department of Physics, Astronomy and mathematics

## About the Department

When you undertake a degree within the University of Hertfordshire, you belong to a Department within a School. The Department has a management group, teaching staff, technical staff, administrative staff and associated research workers. The day-to-day running of the degree that you are enrolled on is by the management group. We pride ourselves on being a friendly and approachable group so that we will all try and help you make the most of your time here.

At the Department of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics we encourage all our students to pursue careers in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine) professions and support both the Juno project and the Athena SWAN Charter. More information can be found on the Department's Equality committee web page.

A good deal of information about the University at large, as well as the Department, is contained on the StudyNet website, and you will be guided to various parts of this throughout your time at the University. It is also the most important way in which both the Department and University communicate with you as part of a cohort of students enrolled on a programme of study [e.g. toward a BSc (Hons) Mathematics], or a particular module (e.g. Physics of Stars). You should check StudyNet every day whilst you are studying.

It is also important that you follow the Health and safety advice that is made available to you in safety handbooks and briefings. This advice covers University-wide activities (e.g. sitting at a computer console or going on a placement) and Department-specific activities.

Another useful compendium is the A-Z of the University of Hertfordshire. There is also the very useful new students web page. On the subject of finding information, answers to frequently asked questions can be found at Ask Herts.

You may find your first few weeks working in a new environment and studying at a new level presents quite a challenge. This is perfectly natural and very common. Feel free to share any concerns that you have with us. Your Personal Tutor, the relevant Year Tutor and Programme Leader, Head of Department, Dean and Associate Deans of School (see management group) are very happy to help you settle in.

## Management group

The Department is managed by a team of staff members together with representatives from the undergraduate and postgraduate student body. The senior member of the management team is the Head of Department, who is in overall charge of the Department and chairs the Department Academic Committee. This committee reflects on the work of the Department, its management and mission. The research areas of the Department are represented by Subject Leaders. The Department is also represented on its Senior Executive Group by key logistics academic staff. Programme Leaders and Year Tutors are responsible for the day-by-day management of the courses that you study. They are the people to ask about your study path and options, the pace and progress of study. During each year of your studies you will also have a Year Tutor, who is your first port-of-call if you need to discuss something or have questions.

The administration of your degree is managed by the Ask Herts Hutton Hub. Academic offences are dealt with by the School Academic Integrity Officer. The facilities of the Department are managed on a day-to-day basis by Principal Technical Officers. Admission to the Department is managed by the Admissions Tutors. Placements are managed by the Department's Placement Tutor.

The Department is, of course, linked to the larger University and to facilitate this we have external members of the Department Academic Committee who are not physically based in the Department. The Department Academic Committee also has members drawn from the academic staff and students nominated by the student body. This is one, but far from the only way, in which students can influence the running of the Department. We have had many excellent suggestions from students that have improved the courses and their management, and we are always keen to hear further ones.

## Where to find us

The Department is a little dispersed geographically, with staff and facilities in different buildings. Most of us are located in or around the Innovation Centre on the College Lane Campus (see the map of the Room Numbers). It is always tricky finding your way round when you first arrive – please ask for help. The rooms are labelled by a letter and a number e.g. D102, and in principle they are like Cartesian coordinates (think of the letters as ‘y’ and the numbers as ‘x’). In addition a number in front indicates the floor so 2H136 is two floors up. However, past experience suggests it is no easier for mathematicians and physicists to find rooms in University of Hertfordshire space-time than other mortals: it could be something to do with non-Euclidean geometry but you decide.

## When to find us

Most staff members have an open-door policy so that you can get very quick access to advice.

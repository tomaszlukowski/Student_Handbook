# Board of Examiners

Broadly speaking, there are two main types of Board of Examiners: Module Boards and Programme Boards.  Module Boards will meet and confirm grades before the meetings of relevant Programme Boards.  The main business of a Programme Board is to make decisions about interim and final awards and about the continuation of students on their programmes.  

Module Boards typically meet at the end of each Semester, and Programme Boards at the endo each academic year.  External Examiners attend Module and Programme Boards for levels 5, 6 and 7.  
More information about Boards of Examiners can be found in UPR AS14 .
